                <p>There has been quite a bit of research on educational games, and the effectiveness of interactive learning. A book on interactive education in math and science outlined the necessary key design features to consider for such a game: clear goals, external scaffolding, feedback, representation of stimuli and the narrative or aesthetic. There are many questions and variables involved in designing a game to best satisfy these features. How do you keep players interested? How do you present information, and how do you report to players that they have successfully learned? How can story and features secondary to gameplay be used to enhance the core goals? How do you communicate clear goals while allowing the player freedoms? Many works aim to quantifiably answer some of these questions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>SeaGame, for example, was developed by researchers at the University of Genoa to understand how games for learning can feel more like video games for commercial entertainment. Its goal was to create a virtual, gamified world in which players would learn the best safety practices for sea-related tasks like sailing or jet-skiing. They had users fill out a variety of pretest questionnaires, play the game for approximately 30 minutes, then evaluated the experience based on how much they learned and how it compared to commercial video games. They found that an effective game has 1) a flow, progression or plot, and 2) simple rules that build into complex patterns. Players enjoyed having intrinsically repetitive mechanisms (like running and jumping in a platforming game), but want them to be applied in varying situations and complexities.

                <br>
                <p>Another paper on guidelines for educational game design was also motivated by current educational games' perceived ineffectiveness and dissimilarity to popular commercial video games, calling them "chocolate-covered broccoli", neither fun nor educationally beneficial. They found that using Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) as a framework for games was empirically proven to be effective. First, the game must define its goal, its rewards, and its reward schedule. Then, it must measure the player's performance through the gameplay, analyze it, and provide feedback. Then, it may provide a reward, or redefine the goal before providing the player with another performance measure (in this case a new puzzle, stage, or level). The key elements to explore here are 1) how you teach concepts and measure performance (gameplay), 2) how you provide feedback (positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement? Positive punishment or negative punishment?), and 3) how you provide rewards and punishment (What are they? Are they at fixed or variable ratios? Are they at fixed or variable intervals?).

                <br><br>
                <p>Along with the general flow and design of educational games, there has also been research on how to best teach computer science. A study on computer science in the US education system found that the key difficulties in including an introductory course in schools were 1) the curriculum needed to be constantly revised, teachers needed to constantly refresh and update their knowledge, 2) it needed to be engaging to students of all ability levels and backgrounds, and 3) access to hardware and software resources. An interactive educational tool could help solve the first two issues: the game's curriculum can be updated and tailored by the developers, though this assumes the game is fun and intrinsically rewarding for most students.

                <br>
                <p>There have been several games developed to teach coding, though these are primarily directed toward children and teenagers. For example, code.org's "Hour of Code" series of interactive games include characters from Disney, Frozen, and Star Wars, where you help the heroes complete various tasks by writing code or snapping blocks together, similar to Scratch. There is also a popular web game called "Code Combat" that offers a gamified course curriculum and management system for middle and high school level programming. All of these use art, animation, and storytelling to create motivation in players, they all use simple systems to present complex problems, and they all provide regular, corrective feedback through sound and visuals. In short, they were quite effective at teaching concepts indirectly, but they were not considering an adult audience.

                <h3 style = "color:black">DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>With the understanding of what makes an effective game for learning, and games that teach programming, I began the development of my own game aimed toward adults. I first decided that there would be a brief story focused on the player as the main character, rather than trying to create an entertaining character. Thinking of my original motivation for creating this project, I figured that my older relatives were more interested in tinkering with and visualizing the code as simply as possible; bright, colorful characters and animations may end up coming across as childish and mental clutter.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src = "img/puzzle1.png">
                <br><br>
                <h6>The interface is relatively simple and subdued.</h6>
                <br>
                <p>Next, I designed my own version of a block-based puzzle code game, similar to code.org's "Hour of Code" games, except with a more subdued color palette, and blocks that fit inside of each other, rather than blocks that snapped together. This was to illustrate the idea of encapsulation more strongly; that various commands can be contained in a loop, and that loop in turn could be contained within another "block" of code.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h6>A screenshot of the tutorial; all blocks are dropped into a gray box for execution. This "code" will DO something, then SAY something.</h6>
                <br>
                <p>The key concepts I aimed to examine were order of execution and looping. The first puzzle asks the user to execute one command to teach the rules and framework of the block system. The second puzzle then has the user execute two commands in a specific order. Then, the player is asked to loop a command. Next, the player must loop multiple commands in a specific order. Finally, the hardest puzzle asks the player to manipulate loops to do commands a certain number of times at different intervals. These concepts kept the scope of the project simple and streamlined, while still allowing for many possible puzzle combinations within the simple block framework.

                <h6>An example of a puzzle that requires creativity and use of all skills learned.</h6>
                <br>
                <p>Pre- and post-questionnaires were designed for this study so that they would correspond to these ideas in the puzzles, and especially the idea of encapsulation. The questions in these surveys asked participants to match code snippets to an English explanation of what they do. The code snippets were designed to see if participants would recognize the concepts of 1) order of execution and 2) looping; namely, how encapsulating brackets in a "for" loop might correspond to the outermost blocks in the game.
