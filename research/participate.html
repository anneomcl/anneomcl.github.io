<h1> Investigation of Interactive Computer Science Education for Adult Learners </h1><br> 

<p>You are invited to participate in a research study on interactive computer science education. This study is conducted by undergraduate Computer Science student Anne McLaughlin from the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. </p>

<p>This study will take approximately 30 to 60 minutes of your time. You will be asked to complete two online surveys about your knowledge of computer science principles and to complete five online puzzles related to those principles.</p>

<p> You may have to download a Unity plug-in for your internet browser. This plug-in collects your MAC address, IP address, device manufacturer, model, OS, browser type, language, number of CPUs present, graphics card type, amount of RAM, and screen resolution of your device. Your unique MAC address is immediately encrypted, and no other information is individually identifying. Third-party services such as Google Forms, itchi.io and Unity Web Player will be used; you may be subject to other passive data collection from these services, such as IP address collection.

<p> Your decision to participate or decline participation in this study is completely voluntary and you have the right to terminate your participation at any time without penalty. You may skip any questions you do not wish to answer. If you want do not wish to complete this survey just close your browser. 

<p>Your participation in this research will be completely confidential and data will be averaged and reported in aggregate. Possible outlets of dissemination may be an academic thesis paper or website. Although your participation in this research may not benefit you personally, it will help us understand if interactive learning is effective in adult computer science education.

<p>There are no risks to individuals participating in this survey beyond those that exist in daily life.

<p>If you are affiliated with the University of Illinois (student, employee, etc.), your decision to participate, decline, or withdraw from participation will have no effect on your current status or future relations with the University of Illinois.
