        <ol>
            <li> Please read all of the instructions before beginning.
            <li> You will be asked to fill out a minute questionnaire before you begin. The link will be in the description beneath the game.
            You may take as much time and use as many resources as needed, though it will likely take 5-10 minutes to complete.
            <li> Next, you will be given 5 puzzles. Try all of them at least once. You may take as much time and use as many resources as you would like, but it's okay to skip if a puzzle takes longer than 5 minutes to solve.
            <li> The game will only work with Internet Explorer or Firefox, and it will also ask you to download a Unity plug-in. Click on the icon labelled "Unity Web Player", follow the instructions to download the plug-in until you can see the game in your internet browser. It is completely safe, but if you do not wish to download anything, then you can close this page and choose not to participate in the study. (Note that some graphics in the web player may be off-center depending on your computer. The game should still be completely playable, however)
            <li> After completing the puzzles, you will be asked to fill out another 5-10 minute questionnaire, which will be linked in the description of the game.
            <li> After finishing the last questionnaire, you may close out of all pages to complete your participation.
            <li> Now click <a href = http://happiecat.itch.io/research> HERE </a> to begin.
